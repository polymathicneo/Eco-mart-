## Design Principles Applied

### Consistency
- All pages use the same navigation bar and footer
- Typography hierarchy is consistent (H1 for page titles, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)
- Spacing and padding follow the same patterns

### User Experience
- Clear navigation with descriptive menu items
- Logical page flow from homepage to subpages
- Adequate white space prevents cluttered appearance
- Call-to-action buttons are prominently placed

### Responsive Considerations
- Grid layouts can adapt to different screen sizes
- Forms are centered and sized appropriately
- Product cards can stack vertically on mobile devices

### Accessibility
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Form labels are descriptive
- Sufficient contrast in wireframes (will be maintained in final design)

## Notes for Development

These wireframes served as the blueprint for our HTML/CSS implementation. The actual website includes:
- External CSS for styling (style.css)
- Internal CSS for page-specific styles
- Inline CSS for specific element styling (as required for coursework)
- JavaScript for interactivity (form validation, popup features)
