            <h2>How Technology is Changing Our Daily Lives</h2>
            <p style="color: #888; font-size: 0.9rem;">Posted on January 6, 2026</p>

            <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
                Technology has totally changed how we do everything nowadays. We wake up to phone alarms,
                check emails before breakfast, and use GPS to get anywhere. It's crazy how different life was
                just 20 years ago when people still used paper maps and landline phones.
            </p>

            <h3>In Our Everyday Life</h3>
            <p>
                Think about it - we don't need to remember phone numbers anymore because they're all saved in our
                contacts.
                We can watch any movie or show instantly instead of going to a video store. Even shopping is different
                now
                since we can order things online and have them delivered the next day.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there's also downsides. All these devices and data centers use tons of electricity. That's why we
                think
                it's important to sell eco-friendly products and raise awareness about sustainable living.
            </p>

            <h3>Technology in Business</h3>
            <p>
                For businesses, technology has made everything faster. Companies can reach customers worldwide through
                the internet. Small stores like ours can compete with big corporations because websites level the
                playing field.
            </p>
            <p>
                We learned a lot about this while making this website. It's not just about writing code - it's about
                understanding how people use technology and making something that actually helps them.
            </p>

                As students working on this project, we've seen firsthand how powerful web technology can be for sharing
                ideas and making positive changes in the world.
